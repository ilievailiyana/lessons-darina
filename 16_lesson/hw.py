EXERCISE 2
In the GE 30424 ENG - Your_Student_ID.py file thereâ€™s the Python custom function create_dict which task is to create a dictionary 
in which the keys are integers and the values are randomly picked from the elements of a sequence. The function is incomplete and must:

have as a mandatory parameter a sequence containing a series of text strings from which to randomly extract the values
have as an optional parameter the number of dictionary elements to be created. In the absence of an argument passed to the function, the default value should be 4
use a loop controlled by a condition to create a dictionary in which the keys are integers starting from 1, whereas the values are randomly picked from the sequence of strings 
passed as a mandatory argument. Note: The dictionary values must be without duplicates
return the created dictionary to the calling instruction
