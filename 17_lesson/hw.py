"""
Create in Python the program Exercise10.5.py containing the function char_frequency which, 
given a string as a mandatory parameter, returns a dictionary in which 
the keys are the characters that make up the string (without repetitions) 
and the values indicate the number of occurrences of the character inside the string.

The main program must ask the user to enter a sentence (to be used as argument of the function), 
call the function, and show on the screen the dictionary returned.

"""

"""
Create the Exercise6.4.py program in Python that contains a function, 
called area_rectangle which, 
having received the base and height as parameters, returns the area of the relative rectangle.

The main program must request the base and height as input, 
call the function and display the result. 

The program must handle any exceptions due to the insertion of incorrect inputs.

"""

"""
Implement a simple text-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game 
where the user can input their choice, and the computer randomly 
selects its choice.

Hint: remember that you can choose randomly an element from a list with:
computer_choice = random.choice(my_list)

Determine the winner based on the normal game rules. Create a function play_rps which accepts the user choice (rock, paper or scissors)
as a parameter and the function returns "You win!" or "You lose!" accordingly. Display the result of the function to the user.
"""

"""
Create a Python program containing the positive_sum function to calculate the sum of positive integers entered by the user.

Requirements:

The function should prompt the user to enter integers one at a time until a negative integer is entered.
If the user enters a negative integer, the input process stops, and the negative integer should not be included in the sum.
The function should return the sum of all positive integers entered by the user.
"""

"""
Create a Python program containing the count_valid_ages function to count the number of valid ages entered by the user.

Requirements:

The function should ask the user to enter ages (integers) one at a time until a non-integer input (such as a string) is entered.
Show the message "Error: age must be between 0 and 120" if the user enters an age less than 0 or greater than 120.
The function should return the total number of valid ages (i.e., ages between 0 and 120, inclusive).

Example: If the user enters 25, 85, -5, 130, 42, the function should return 3.
"""

"""
Create a Python program containing the even_product function to calculate the product of even numbers entered by the user.

Requirements:

The function should prompt the user to enter integers one at a time until the user enters 0.
The function should only consider even numbers for the product calculation.
If no even numbers are entered, the function should return 1 as the product.
The function should return the product of all even numbers entered.

Example: If the user enters 4, 3, 6, 0, the function should return 24.
